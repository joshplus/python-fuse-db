# python-fuse-sample

This repo contains a FUSE filesystem example in Python. It started life based on the code from this post:

https://www.stavros.io/posts/python-fuse-filesystem/

The purpose of this project is to create a fuse filesystem where files are backed by a specific blob field inside of MySQL/MariaDB. This is to make some things in my day job a bit easier. It's still early stages, of course. As of the time of writing, there haven't even been any code changes :)
